It can also refer to the person undertaking this act. So the entire story, as we can discern from the first chapter; is basically about a bunch of zoomers outsourcing their love life (ren'ai) to other people (daikou) because they are so braindead they dont even have the cognitive ability to properly function and know what to do when fall in love. don't care about the means as long as get to the ends, and would rather just be spoonfed everything in their vegetative state. ~goddamn hate it already: sasuga genius mangaka akasaka aka: ~oldpier About The Merchant of Venice JESSICA Here, catch this casket: It is worth the pains_ The Merchant of Venice is a play written by William Shakespeare. 35 am glad 'tis night, do not look on me Here , in Act 2 Scene 6, Jessica elopes with Lorenzo, a Christian, and For am much ashamed of my exchange later also converts to Christianity: This caused her Jewish father; the But love is blind, and lovers cannot see antagonist Shylock; to become even more determined to exact The pretty follies that themselves commit revenge on Antonio, the protagonist, on of several other reasons For if could Cupid himself would blush for him to want to do sO (https Ilen wikipedia orglwikilThe Merchant_of_Venice) 40 To see me thus transformed to About kitsune (foxes) and tanuki (raccoon dogs) Kokon's Agent Nickname is \"Kon\", based on her name. In Japan, the onomatopoeia for sounds made by foxes (kitsune) is \"kon-kon\" (which Im sure many of you would already know if you follow a certain vtuber agency) , thus her mascot here is a fox. (Also she's making a fox shape with her hand here ) Kengo's mascot is a tanuki (raccoon dog): Their associated sound effect is Pon\" which is the sound of the drumming of their bellies. Thus his Agent Nickname is Pon\" The leaf on the tanuki's head gives the tanuki the p)l 1 power to shapeshift: Curiously, the leaf is also seen on Kon's fox mascot's head, even though are not normally associated with foxes in Japanese folklore. The leaf can also be spotted in both the main title design and the chapter title design: It is also worth noting that as mischievous and magical shape-shifting animals in Japanese folklore , the kitsune and the tanuki are often paired in Japanese 3 E 2 culture. One such contrast is in Japanese food, in particular kitsune udon, which contains fried tofu, and tanuki udon, which contains flakes of tempura batter: Related reading: https Iliapanesegallery comlanime and mangalblog-paqelanime-mangaliapanese-folklore-vokai-the-kitsune-and-the-tanuki html they They they you top they boy: K 3 they #"

In this cooking strategy; 5 ingredients are tied to each one character to these: sugar (satou), salt (shio), vinegar (su), soy sauce (Seiyu), and Miso (Miso Iol). Aka the self proclaimed genius had the idea to change this to things that work for conversation interiections: sasuga (lil: a behaviorltrait expected to cone from a person; or for us \"same aS alwaysl\") , shirankatta (so thals how it worksl), Sugoi (Superbl), Sensu ii (lit: good sense; but for this case; \"Spectacular/\") and sounanda (So | seel). As you can see, lhey dont quite fit in english; so it turns out a bit Messy wilth our \"5 Ss of Backchanneling\" Anyways; if you were wondering why those phrases May have sounded odd, its because we would have to rewrite the entire dialogue to Make the words make perfect sense; so we sacrificed length to fit Akas bit. For More information on \"Backchanneling' Backchanneling refers to the verbal and non-verbal cues; responses, or signals that listeners provide to a speaker during a conversation It is a way to acknowledge the speaker; show engagement; and maintain the flow of comMunication: Backchanneling can take various forms; including brief verbal utterances like \"uh-huh;\" \"yeah;\" or See;' as well as non-Verbal cues such as nodding, Maintaining eye contact, or using facial expressions like Smiling or frowning The purpose of backchanneling is to signal to the speaker that the listener is actively listening and understanding {he Message; It serves as a feedback MechanisM; encouraging the speaker to continue and providing lhem with reassurance or confirmation that lhey are being heard. Backchanneling is often used in everyday conversations, interviews, presentations, or any situation where effective communication and active listening are important Backchanneling is culturally influenced, and different cultures May have different norMs and expectations regarding the use of backchanneling: In sone cultures, backchanneling May be More explicil and frequent, while in others il May be less pronounced or even discouraged It is essential to be aware of cultural variations and adjust onels backchanneling behavior accordingly when engaging in cross-cultural communication Thanks for readingl Jazz Man, Odokuro, and RapidDragon Foxachu Agency Translators https:lIkokorocares comlblogslbloglsa-shi-su-se-so-the-building-blocks-of-japanese-cuisine# ~ tex t-Essential%zoto%zothe%zOfoundation%zoofmiso) get",
